"Rapha's place is so tidy and the dog there is so friendly. My friend and I had a really good time there. Rapha is such a friendly host and he'll always give us some suggestions for restaurants or places to travel. The location of the flat is easy to find, and it's just next to the metro station, which is very convenient. The Sagrada Familia, a hot tourist spot, is right next door. We can walk to the city center in no time even at night. We still feel safe walking to the apartment from the metro. I strongly recommend people to stay there while staying in Barcelona.",9
"The apartment's in a good spot, high up in town with a awesome view (from Main St).  It's about a 15-20 minute walk uphill to the nearest Metro - but the area is quiet. The outside terrace is amazing - we loved having breakfast there. There's a nice little shop just next door. The apartment and bedding + towels were clean, so even though it's a full time/only guest apartment, we can recommend it.",7
"The house is really well equipped and it's super pretty (except for the wife's internet which is really bad). It's a bit far from the tourist centers, though.  The only thing that was a problem was that our flight got delayed two hours and when we finally arrived two hours later than our scheduled time, after 8 p.m., they charged us 30 euros at check-in.",6
"Our host's friend was outside when we arrived, which was a bonus since we were travelling with our two kids. We got shown around the apartment and Regina put together all the guides for us. The apartment was as pictured and the kids loved it; we were only a 5-minute walk from a local supermarket.  Parents be warned! There are some steep hills, slightly difficult with the stroller/buggy, but a good workout either way. We were about a 10-12 minute walk to the subway, Alfonso X, which was only 4 stops from the Ramblas - thumbs up!  We loved our stay and our two kids felt very comfortable in the apartment; they loved the patio, there were plenty of playgrounds nearby. The neighborhood was quiet and the locals were really helpful.",8
"Dirty and very unrecommendable.  It has difficult accessibility, absolute lack of cleanliness and a strong smell of moisture caused by keeping wet sheets inside the only closet in the house, covered with mildew inside. Absolute lack of cleaning throughout the entire house that made it very uncomfortable to stay there, especially with young children. The sofa where you were supposed to sleep had a big stain that they didn't even bother trying to clean up. There was only one closet covered in mildew for storing clothes, which we obviously couldn't use. The shower was black, chipped and rusty, so we had to clean it ourselves and disinfect it a bit just to be able to use it. The kitchen was full of grease that made it useless for cooking anything. Stairs down completely steep and narrow.  Not even a sign of Regina or Juan, a person greeted us who didn't even know how to speak good Spanish, so I doubt the existence of Juan and Regina. It is absolutely shameful that when you pay for the apartment they charge you some cleaning fees that they didn't do. In addition, we were charged 30€ in the check-in. The area is quiet although quite far from the metro, given that you have some steep steps from the nearest metro station and then you have to climb uphill about 15 minutes. Considering the host's efforts, absolutely none. The person who welcomed us didn't even know how to tell us where the closest shop was, a parking lot where we could leave our car and even the nearest metro station. I am a user of this website for a long time, I have visited other countries in Europe using it and this has been by far the worst experience I've ever had.  I feel completely scammed.",1
"Real Barcelona neighborhood vibe. Nice people, tons of places to grab stuff 'n snacks and fresh fruits/veggies, plus awesome city views from up high.",9
"The neighborhood was very chill and calm, a nice change from the city center and the beaches, so it was like a cool retreat for chilling out.",7
"The apartment is pretty cool and well-equipped, in a nice neighborhood. It kind of matches the Airbnb listing. Unfortunately, it has a constant damp smell and it's also quite far from the subway and public parking. The host gave us a lot of info before we got there but we didn't see them at all during our stay. I also requested a change to the booking which I never heard back about. Overall, it was a good experience.",7
"This apartment's perfect for a big famiy. The rooms are big, clean, and cool. The kitchen's basic but works good, and the outside space is nice. Maks let us in and showed us around, and he was quick to answer any questions while we were there.",7
"The apartment is as described. It's nice; you feel like you're home there. There's a slight damp smell that's kinda unpleasant. But with the windows open, the smell goes away quickly.",7
"At first the concierge was supposed to meet us. Once we arrived, neither the host nor the concierge answered our calls. Luckily a young girl was waiting outside the apartment who explained that she was supposed to meet us but we weren't aware of it.   Luckily she was very nice, welcomed us well and explained how the stay would go.   Once in the apartment we realized it was very dusty and had to do some cleaning because one person was allergic to mites. We also had to buy cleaning products because the ones on-site were very limited.  As for the equipment, a lot of things were provided (dishwasher, washing machine, ironing board, hairdryer, etc) but there was very limited dishes for 3 people (lack of glasses and forks).  Attention: There are no blinds or opaque curtains on 2 out of the 3 bedrooms. However bed sheets and towels are provided. However, a bath mat is missing for the bathtub.  The mattresses were comfortable and the neighbourhood very quiet apart from a neighbor who sometimes played loud music.  On the level of the location, the apartment is very well located because it's a 10-minute walk to the metro line that serves all the important places in the city (beach, city center, gothic quarter, etc).  However, attention for people who have difficulty moving because the apartment is at the top of a very steep hill.  In spite of everything, we had a pleasant stay in this apartment and enjoyed the shaded terrace.",5
"The apartment's pretty cool and everything's super clean, all good",7
A really nice and big apartment: ideal for going there with kids! Everything's really clean and tidy.,7
"The information stuff could use a little sorting, since everything's there multiple times and you don't know what's current anymore. In the back bedroom next to the bathroom should be a blackout curtain because you can see straight through from the landing, it's just a thin, see-through curtain. Unfortunately no coffee machine in a size for 6 people available, and the other one has no kettle either. We also don't have wine glasses for more than one person. But the worst thing was the smell, Modrich, musty, hard to stand, we considered breaking up but couldn't find an affordable place that suited us.  Also, one of us had an accident and couldn't leave France, but there was no discount. Very sad but what do you expect when it's commercial.",2
"Five girls living in the apartment. It's a big place and the distance to the city center is ok (you can walk, use the metro and bus). When we arrived, all of us noticed a smell all over the apartment – like kind of moldy. This sadly affected our stay in the apartment. The bedding had the smell too, and this was bad! The sink was broken among other things.  Otherwise it's a big apartment with a little outside terrace.  - Camilla, Andrea, Cecilie, Kia and Heidi",3
"Mixed experience.  It's true that the street is calm and you can enjoy the pretty view of Barcelona, but you'll have to climb steep slopes to get to the apartment. Plus, in the building, the staircase is very narrow and there isn't an elevator. Access could therefore be difficult for families with young children, elderly people, and people with reduced mobility, especially since it's located on the ground floor of the building, below the ground floor.   The photos are not very faithful to reality because the apartment lacks brightness, apart from the terrace, there is a lack of windows and none open onto the exterior. The only other window present in one of the rooms faces the building's staircase.  Because of this lack of windows, the apartment isn't very bright and feels enclosed.  There's also bad sound insulation in the apartment but it hasn't been too annoying as the building was generally quiet overall.   Positive point: friendly and available host, proximity to Guell Park and public transportation   Given the price-quality ratio, I think it's best suited for a group of friends.",5
"Regina was chatty before we moved into the apartment, and even though she couldn't meet us while we were there, she set up someone to let us in with the keys and info. The place is super nice in a peaceful neighborhood.",8
The place is big and it's in a cool part of town,4
"My group of four friends and I had a great stay at Regina's Airbnb. The apartment looked just like the pictures and was super clean. Regina was easy to get in touch with before we got there and she coordinated for her friend Maks to meet us when we arrived. There was plenty of space for the five of us in the apartment. We really enjoyed the outdoor patio and spent our mornings out there to eat breakfast that we made in the well-equipped kitchen. We did wish there had been some basic kitchen stuff like salt, spices, or oil there for us to use. The location was a quick walk to Park Güell and it was nice being in a non-touristy area. That did mean though, that it wasn't as easy to get to the city center.",7
"Regina has always been very helpful and willing to meet our requests. Whatever problem we had she was ready to advise us the best way possible.  The ad description reflects the apartment, which is generally very welcoming. It's equipped with everything that we need. The neighborhood is a bit far from the city center, but by walking a short distance and then taking the metro, it takes just a little time to reach the city center; taxi service is fairly cheap and convenient to use after the metro stops close.  That being said, it was an amazing experience!",8
"Communication with Regina was awesome. The flat's a bit far from the city center, but we got there using the metro, no problem at all! We had a great chance to see the sunrise in Park Guel and I know it wouldn't have been possible without staying here. Thanks!",8
"Good spot, easy communication with the host, we got in late but they let us check-in.  But the flat's kinda dark and smells funky.",7
"My friends and I were really bummed when we got to Regina's place. First off, the pictures made it look like you could see the view from inside. But nope!  You can only see it from outside the building, and that was a big bummer. You also can't get the view from the terrace either. It's kinda confusing,  Second, the smell in the bedding is off-putting. Like, super bad. My husband couldn't sleep there, it was awful! Luckily we managed to change rooms to the dining room and slept on the couch that turned into a bed. The main problem with Regina's place was the smell. She said it's because of the apartment's location. But, despite all that, she was a great host.  She let us leave our bags at her family's hotel when we checked out because we had four hours before heading to the airport. We did have fun mainly on the terrace which is right next to the kitchen. The neighborhood was awesome – quiet with a big market and bus stops super close by. It's easy to get to the city center, even night buses stop right there! Bunkers de can Baro are just a 10-minute walk uphill from the apartment. They had a spectacular view of the whole city. We had a great time in Barcelona.  It's magical.",6
We had a really great time staying in this place. Regina is super nice and flexible...  I highly recommend this place.,9
"A little bit out of town and not too well connected... For the rest, a decent little house",4
"Regina's house was a great place to stay. It's located in a high area which makes it great for an amazing view of the city. And you can easily reach the center with a bus or metro. The house is just like shown in the photos, with a beautiful terrace to have your breakfast in the sunny morning. It's well-equipped with the essentials and there's a little supermarket nearby to buy food. Overall, great place :)",8
"The house is spacious and we feel good even with 4/5 people.  The external space is very nice and useful, a little bit off-center getting to the top floor!  But the upper part above park guell is very beautiful! Just a heads up that it's an unfinished basement which is kinda damp, but we still like it!",7
"The apartment was beautiful, clean, and well-equipped. Regina was super easy to communicate with and always responded right away. The apartment is about a 15 minute walk from Park Guell and has a great little grocery store down the elevator and a fantastic view outside just up the stairs. Just be mindful though of the two small flights of stairs down to the apartment, they're really small and really steep and narrow. Also, be prepared to walk uphill if you go anywhere. The concierge Alex was awesome and had great recommendations!",8
The place was clean and was comfy. There was a smell of mildew like some people mentioned in earlier posts. The steps up to the apartment were super small. The outside patio was pretty and a big bonus! We had a good time at that place.,7
"We really enjoyed staying at her place. The rooms were clean, and everything else was alright too.  Getting into the city center was pretty easy. We'd recommend staying there!",7
"The apartment interior matches the photos. When we were choosing a place to live, we somehow decided that the photo with the view of Sagrada Familia was the window view...that's not right)))! The apartment location is inconvenient. It takes about a kilometer to walk from the metro station to a steep hill (great replacement for the gym). There might be an bus stop nearby but I didn't bother looking into Barcelona's bus routes. A taxi from the waterfront - around €20. The neighborhood is quiet.  It seems safe, too)))!  About getting in - everything is fine. We were met, shown around and offered any help.",5
"Nice apartment close to the Parc Guell, matches the photos. Quiet spot. However, communicating with Regina was a bit of a hassle.  When we arrived, Regina gave us a phone number for someone who wasn't aware of our stay – thankfully, someone was in the apartment to welcome us.  Also, we didn't have WiFi at the apartment.  But aside from these little issues, we had a nice time with Regina and Juan.",7
"Great location!  A bit of a climb to get there on foot, otherwise everything is fine, except for the fact that we didn't have hot water for three days.  Small drawback: The tourist tax 2.55 euros per day, it's really expensive, way too expensive for young students.",7
"We got to the apartment and there wasn't a free park on the street like the apartment description said. After unloading our bags, we watched a discussion between the tenants of the apartments and the person who was going to check us in. We had to wait with the suitcases outside until the conversation finished and then only then did we go inside. The person who received us wasn't anything friendly or nice at all. The house smelled bad when we got there, it was dirty, the floors were dirty and the bedsheets looked like they had been changed months ago. The bathroom smelled of mildew, full of humidity and the towels smelled bad. Even though the space was pretty, it had a lot of negative aspects so I don't recommend it to anyone.",1
"The house wasn't what we expected; for example: - It had a strong smell of humidity (despite being unhygienic), and ventilation was very limited, making it quite hot.  - The level of cleanliness was bad, with some dust (half the bedsheets were dirty) and the cleaning utensils not very clean. We weren't sure about the cleanliness of the kitchen towels either, which were spread out on the table when we arrived.  - Both mattresses were in poor condition, and one of the beds had a loose leg.   - There weren't enough utensils in the kitchen - 2 spoons, 3 forks, a lid for pots, etc. The bathroom was missing face towels.  As for the neighborhood it was quite quiet, and even though it's 15 minutes from the metro, we recommend taking the bus to avoid carrying heavy luggage uphill.  It's near the Bunker del Carmel which has an amazing view of BCN, and supermarkets are open late.",2
"Pretty far from the city center and a weird smell. Otherwise, no complaints!",4
"It was a nice stay, the beds were clean, the TV works well, and the internet is fast. There's only one private room with a door since the other has just a privacy curtain and everyone else has to pass by if they want to go to the kitchen or living room, so there's no real privacy. The apartment is in a constantly rising area because it's mountainous and far from the metro, supermarkets, and the city center…the nearest bus is the 24 which takes you to Plaça Catalunya in 5 minutes by walking. Otherwise, it's good. I recommend it if you want to go on a trip away from noise and peace.",7
"The location is great, the check-in is efficient and quick, the building is quiet, shops nearby. Only downside: the only bathroom has the toilet, which is a problem for five people. If you're 3 or 4, it's perfect. Anything more than that, it's too small.",7
"Pros: Good location (5 mins from Parc Güell and 20 mins to Sagrada Familia on foot), clean inside with good bedding. A bit of a lingering damp smell in the kitchen that needs fixing.  Cons:  Very hard to find free parking because there's very little space available. Otherwise, you can pay for parking for 10 hours per day. Good location (1.3 km from the Alphonse X metro station) but the path is quite steep. Easy descent but difficult to come back up.",7
"The house was very clean and big, the wifi works good. Perfect for 6 people because there's enough space. The kitchen is new and has everything you need to cook (even microwave and coffee machine). The metro is not far, about 10 minutes walk.",8
We had a really nice time at Alexandra's apartment. It's on a quiet street but still close to public transport. The bed was comfy and had great pillows! Her neighbor was super nice and opened our bottle of wine because we couldn't find a corkscrew. I'd totally recommend her place for your next adventure in this cool city.,8
"No shampoo or soap, even though it says on the listing that there will be shampoo. When I asked her about it she said it wasn't included and I had to screenshot her own listing to show her what it says. Only hand soap in the bathroom. I know shampoo isn't that big of a deal but I specifically didn't buy it because it said we would have some at the apartment.  No wine opener either. I also messaged her about it and she was sure that it was in the kitchen but then I looked back in some of the reviews and found a couple of them that says they couldn't find it either. It seems like she doesn't really know her own listing that well.   We never actually met Alexandra and checked in with her friend, Anastasia. She checked us in right at 2 pm and was nice.   The apartment itself was clean and the couch is actually better than the one in the pictures but some of the decorations were different. No biggie though.   The only thing about the apartment is there's ONLY ONE FAN. There are two bedrooms and three sleeping areas, but we shared one fan which was impossible. It was very hot in the morning.   Parking was a little tricky because of the hills and one way streets, but we found a spot by the place.   Overall okay.",5
"Thanks for the parking advice, sir/madam! The house is beautifully decorated; especially that little courtyard. Thanks so much for everything you've done!",9
"A chill spot in a decent spot with a cool host.  There's a bit of damp air, and it's tough to find parking. A simple hotel with pretty much the same things would be cheaper I reckon...",5
"Damp apartment, a persistent musty smell even with the windows open, walls starting to swell, basic kitchenware, bathroom lacking ventilation and an unpleasant smell from the toilet even after multiple cleanings, nice terrace and washing machine for laundry available which is super convenient, apartment on top floor of Barcelona just two bus stops away from Parc Guell which is super convenient, but be prepared for at least 40 minutes of bus to get to the beach, apartment that will suit a group of young friends.",4
"Good place to stay for two days in Barcelona. Bad smell in the apartment (smell from old furniture and mold). Impossible to find parking nearby, even though on Airbnb we found this location with parking included",5
"The location's good, on a slope. The room's cozy, but there's a musty smell and no bug repellent. Asked the landlady, who said they don't have any mosquitos.",4
"Basement apartment without windows, damp in Barcelona.   Really remote, no public transportation, no shops.  Not recommended for families.",1
"Unfortunately, the apartment smells bad and it's really gross.  They don't have any blankets, so it's freezing! It's super messy and damp too.  The only good thing is where it's located. I wouldn't recommend",2
"Perfect situation for us, but the place is really disappointing because of its topography and humidity smell. Alexandra was a great host who listened to us and made an effort to make us happy.  That's still not enough for us to plan on coming back.",5
"Cute place, well-stocked kitchen and bathroom. Quiet and safe neighborhood and close to restaurants and grocery stores.  Very close to Park Güell, but a bit far from the Barcelona city center. Alexandra was great with communicating and super quick to respond.",7
It was our first time using Airbnb' and it was really good. Thanks for everything!,8
"Access to the place is convenient. There's a parking lot just 10 meters away (20€ per day). The residence is well-kept.  Two elevators for access to the sixth floor. The apartment is perfectly silent, no noise from the street.  The accommodation is ideal for groups, it's clean and in great condition. Two sets of keys are available at your disposal. I highly recommend this accommodation.  To get around town, it's a 15-minute walk to sights, taxis pass by on the street, everything is convenient. Finally, the terrace is amazing, with a view of the AGBAR tower.     Thank you for your hospitality, we'll be back soon!",9
"The apartment's awesome, right in the city center and with all the stuff we needed. Regina was really helpful with our needs.",9
"Great stay, super nice flat like it was described. Nice balcony and well-located! The host was cool and easy to get in touch with",7
"Everything was fine. The apartment was clean. A couple useful items weren't available, like a trash can or a drying rack for dishes. But obviously thats an easy thing to buy. Overall a nice place.  Nothing to do with the host, but the walls are paper thin. You can hear what the neighbors are doing on every side of the flat.",5
Friendly welcome and clean apartment that's exactly as described,7
"Awesome apartment! A parking spot just two steps away which was super helpful. Regina is really welcoming, I recommend this apartment.",9
We had a great time at Regina's place. The flat was clean and as shown in the pics.,7
"The apartment and location is good, but the service isn't as good as expected.  I booked a pick-up service from the homeowner, but there were some problems happened about the plane causing the flight delayed. I informed the homeowner right away. When we arrived at the airport, we couldn't find the driver waiting for us at the arrival with our name. Then, I tried to ask the homeowner for help meeting the driver at the airport. After almost an hour of waiting, we were refused by the driver to meet at the airport and he asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we couldn't even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take a taxi. At the same time, I texted the homeowner that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on our way to our apartment by taxi.  The homeowner didn't tell me that I should call another guy to tell him that we were on our way to the apartment until we arrived. All she talked about was the money for the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes waiting for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but you didn't provide it with us. How dare you ask for the payment? Besides, do you know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro total. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the homeowner and the guy. I doubt that they're on business to play tricks with me.   Barcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me.",2
"The apartment's location is great; it's close to the metro and walking distance from Sagrada Familia, and there are tons of good places to eat. It's spacious with a nice balcony. The air conditioners are in the main hallway and living room, but the rooms are kinda hard to cool down (it was really hot when we were there).",7
"Hey, everything's great, excellent location and the service is really nice. The only thing I'd say is to fix up",7
"What an awesome place to stay! It's a super big and comfy place, and it's in a great spot. The deck area is amazing, and we spent most of our time there just hanging out and taking in the views. Reginan was really good at communicating, and made it super easy for us to get here. If I ever go back to Barcelona, I'd 100% stay here again!",9
"Everything was going really well, the apartment matched exactly with the photos on the website. The rooms and bathrooms were clean too, as was the kitchen. The terrace was super nice and the view was great. There was also a sofa bed which was super comfy. The air conditioning worked well and cooled down the whole place. The only problem we had was the bathroom door that was easy to close, but then wouldn't open again, but there was a quick fix from the apartment managers who helped get someone out who was stuck inside. Other than that, the neighborhood was quiet with little bars around and even some mini-food stores. It was also possible to walk to many bars for fun. Taxis to get into the party zone cost between 5 and 7 euros per ride. The metro station was just a 5-minute walk from the apartment. There was a bus that went directly to the airport for only 4 euros and 90.",9
Regina's a great host and the apartment's perfect for big groups because of its awesome location. It's a five-minute drive or fifteen-minute walk to the beach and close to all the awesome tourist spots! I definitely recommend this super clean and well-decorated apartment 100%!,9
"Regina was a great host - first she replied super quickly to my booking inquiry, and was always super responsive with queries/messages.  The flat is HUGE and super well-located, super modern and nicely decorated. Regina had organised someone to meet us on arrival so check in was easy. Check out was easy too because we just had to leave the flat at the agreed time. I would only say that the checkout time of 11am is a bit early, especially for a city where you can have dinner quite late... although upon our request, Regina let us stay until 12pm. There were two sets of keys which was super convenient for a big group.  I suggested to Regina that it would be great to have a few more amenities provided like toilet paper and coffee/tea for example, but overall we were super happy with our stay at Regina's place. Thanks Regina!",8
The department is fantastic and has a pretty big terrace to enjoy. Both the hosts and Maks (the concierge) were very nice and helpful.,9
"Great location!   Right next to all the main attractions. Tons of shops and restaurants nearby. ( BTW you can go to the sushi bar – 5 minutes walk – Kyoka II, with unlimited food.  Menu's only in Spanish :) )  The apartments are comfy and clean. I think it would be awesome for a family vacation!  IMHO some minor improvements need to be made (like the broken shower hose support, etc), but it's not that big of a deal.   Overall – good experience.",8
"Regina's apartment was as listed on her profile - there was enough space for all 8 of us, and it had all of the amenities listed on the page. It was a really good area. I would recommend anyone in a big group looking to stay in a central location.",8
"Great apartment if you're a bigger group and want some extra space. The bedrooms are all awesome and just like they said, plus having two bathrooms was super nice. The terrace is a total win with amazing views!",9
"The apartment's even better than it looks in the photos. The location is awesome. It's close to everything, and you can walk to different points of interest like Sagrada Familia and the marina. Or for those who prefer the metro, there are several metro stations nearby, which makes it super convenient. We definitely recommend it one hundred percent! If we go back to Barcelona, we'll definitely stay here again.",9
"We stayed here with 8 people for a fun weekend in Barcelona and this apartment was a great home base for us. The apartment is exactly what the pictures showed and Regina and Juan were great hosts. Location is a little bit out of the way if you want to be central, but proximity to la Sagrada Familia was nice!",7
"My family went on a great vacation in Barcelona and stayed at her house.  The location is awesome for going to famous places and you can easily get a bus or taxi.  Getting around is super convenient!   The house is big and comfy for my family, 8 people.  There are four rooms and two bathrooms.  It was such a good time for my family.",9
"The area is really nice. The place is clean and pleasant, but super noisy – bummer.",6
Regina was super nice. She gave us all the info and always helped when we needed anything. The apartments were super cozy and comfy. Everything was there for easy living. We had a blast in Barcelona!,9
"Good place for a big group. Checking in and out was super easy, it was easy to find transportation to explore the rest of the city. The balcony was a awesome bonus!",7
"Great place, centrally located. Communication with the host Regina was perfect. Thanks for the awesome stay!",9
The apartment is comfy and well-located but it needs a deep clean.,6
"Regina's place is great for up to 7 people, with 4 separate bedrooms, a common area with a big table so everyone can sit down, a small living room and a terrace, which is nice to hang out on outside too.  Just know that one of the double beds is smaller than usual, so best for a single person or a couple super in love! The bathrooms weren't well stocked, no soap and only a few toilet paper rolls, but Regina's staff brought us some when we asked. We didn't use the kitchen much.  Being a group of friends, we didn't like that all the beds were double sheets. Unfortunately at check-in we had to wait about an hour for the lady with the keys, which wasn't the best start.  The apartment isn't in the center, so we didn't use public transport and it was a 35-minute walk to the city center. The closest metro station we used once was also a 10-minute walk away. But it was ok for us.",7
"Everything's fine, except for a few details… that will be sorted out with the other guests. Thanks",5
"Super apartment. Great location and matches the photos and description. Warm welcome even after 10pm, even though we paid an extra fee for the late check-in. Awesome place!!",9
"Everything's great, the department is really comfortable, good location.",7
Awesome apartment for a big group!,7
"Really nice apartment! The terrace is amazing and everything looks like the pictures. Communication was no problem, check in on time & quick. The flat has everything you need (even a hairdryer, ironing board and so on). We were a group of friends with enough space and would come back anytime.",9
The terrace has a nice view.,4
"The room is big enough for 7 people to stay. But there's a problem with the shower fixture – the handheld sprayer can't be fixed on the holder, so we have to hold it ourselves. This is a little inconvenient. We tried contacting the landlord by phone and text message but didn't get any response. The dryer is super dirty and even after cleaning for hours, we couldn't use it. There's a supermarket nearby where you can buy what you need. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the Church of Saint James.",4
"Cute, clean, and pretty central. Walkable to Sagrada Familia (7 mins) and also to the beach (15 mins). We were two families of four and were really comfortable.",8
"The apartment's awesome, in a nice neighborhood and perfect for a group of friends or family. It's in a good spot, close to the metro station and within walking distance to Sagrada Familia. There are some good local shops nearby on the way to Sagrada Familia, and the balcony is the best part! Plus, the apartment basically has everything you need! My family and I loved our stay!",9
"The apartment was super clean and as described. We really enjoyed it. It's so spacious, and the balcony is awesome. The host was super nice and helpful. The neighborhood is quiet, and there's a grocery store right in front of the apartment. A really great place to stay in Barcelona!",9
Great place for a vacation with friends,4
"The apartment's location is great, it has a big balcony, perfect for having drinks with friends while enjoying the night view. The room is pretty clean, but the kitchen and washing machine need some scrubbing! You can't hang the shower head in the bathroom - you'll have to get a new one. The air conditioner looks really dirty and needs cleaning too.  The nightly cost for each person is 2.25 euros, which is higher than other places. Make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully.",7
"The host was great at communicating with us and let us check in early.  The check-in process was really organized. The place was big and super clean. It was just as described in the ad. Good Wi-Fi, AC, and water pressure in the apartment. The apartment is on the 6th floor of an apartment building and has a nice view from the balcony. The unit isn't super close to tons of tourist spots but it's about a mile away from the beach and a 15-minute walk to a park with some sights.   While we were there, there was a chemical leak scare that the fire department showed up for and evacuated the building for a few hours. The host didn't reply when we contacted them about it.  Still, we got back in after a few hours and ended up enjoying the rest of our trip.",7
We had a great time there. The apartment was clean and had a really nice balcony with enough space for 8 people to sit. Communication was fast and easy.  Recommendation!,8
"The place is nicely decorated, super clean and has all the stuff you need.   There's a huge dining room connected to a nice balcony with a beautiful view of the Agbar Tower A 10-minute walk to Sagrada Familia, and 5 minutes to Diagonal. It's ideally located in the city center and close to transportation. Regina pays attention to potential comments to improve her guests' experience and solve any issue they might encounter. I totally recommend this place and Regina without any hesitation!",9
Awesome spot and a tidy place!,7
"It's an awesome apartment, clean and decorated nicely. It has all the comforts and is located in a great spot. There are connections for transportation and it's close to tourist spots, highly recommended",9
"Nice apartment, good location, good size, very clean nice views of the Torre Agbar. No hot water for a shower. Host no responding.",5
I was charged 32€ in tourist tax without a receipt.,2
"The apartment was really nice for a group of seven - two families with teenagers. Location's perfect, not far from the Metro, right around Sagrada Familia.  Overall it was a good place to stay, bathrooms and sleeping rooms are fine, living room's good too, kitchen equipment is kinda ""worn out"". But in the end we didn't come to Barcelona to cook. We enjoyed our stay.",7
"Conveniently located and clean. The kitchen might need updating, but do you really *need* a kitchen when in Barcelona?",7
